# What am I talking about?

* Old code, (with better and simple to achieve improvements)
* Ugly code
* Stupidly fragile
* Plain broken
~~~SECTION:notes~~~
* All of the following was the aim.
* I appear to have burnt some of my best(or is that worst) examples.
* *mostly* not that opinionated.  Some solutions are improvements but other people might have better ideas.
